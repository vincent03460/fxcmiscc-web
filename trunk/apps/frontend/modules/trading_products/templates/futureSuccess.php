<p><?php echo __("Futures contracts are financial assets just like stocks and bonds, but with some important differences that are what makes futures such an appealing investment for traders. It is a standardised and exchange-traded contract that requires delivery of an asset at a specific price on a specific future date. In addition, it represents an undertaking to execute a certain transaction at a future date under the terms of the contract.") ?></p>
<p><?php echo __("You can buy a futures contract on gold, silver, copper, zinc, crude oil, live cattle, corn, wheat and many other items. The underlying item or commodity is described specifically in the contract specifications which are determined by the futures exchange on which it trades. The price of a futures transaction is agreed upon initially between buyer and seller, and remains fixed over the holding period, or length of the contract. At CMIS Trader, futures contracts do not involve delivery of commodities via the traditional method. This means that the futures contracts close automatically when trading operations are completed.
