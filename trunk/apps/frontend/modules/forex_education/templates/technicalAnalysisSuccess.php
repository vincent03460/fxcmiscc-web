<p><?php echo __("Lesson 8 ï¿½? What is Technical Analysis?") ?></p>
<p><?php echo __("Technical analysis is the forecasting of future market trends and price movements through the research of market data and figures that are presented in charts. It is a perfect fusion of professional knowledge and the different methods of research. Technical analysis has the following advantages over fundamental analysis:") ?></p>
<p><strong><?php echo __("(1) Operability:") ?></strong></p>
<p><?php echo __("Any factors affecting the market will eventually be reflected in the price movements which can be plotted on a chart. By following the trends depicted by the graphs, we will be able to grasp the momentum of the market. This is something that fundamental analysis greatly lacks.") ?></p>
<p><strong><?php echo __("(2) High flexibility:") ?></strong></p>
<p><?php echo __("Technical analysis can be applied to all kinds of speculative markets. Once you have mastered its application, you will be able to simultaneously track as many markets as you like. In comparison, the complexity in data acquisition for fundamental analysis often overwhelms analysts so much that they are forced to concentrate on a single product or market.") ?></p>
<p><strong><?php echo __("(3) Applicable for any time frame:") ?></strong></p>
<p><?php echo __("Technical analysis can be flexibly applied to any time frame. You can apply technical analysis easily whether you are tracking price movement within the same day, or doing mid to long-term market analysis. This is different from fundamental analysis which is only applicable to macroeconomic studies.") ?></p>
<p><strong><?php echo __("(4) Clear buy/sell indicators:") ?></strong></p>
<p><?php echo __("The biggest advantage of technical analysis is that it is able to determine entry points in the trading process. No matter how well you can perform fundamental analysis, technical analysis is still more useful in actual trading.") ?></p>
